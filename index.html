    <!-- INTRO / OVERVIEW SECTION -->
    <h2>Instructor Information & Release Notes</h2>
    <p>This page summarizes teaching notes and outreach tasks for this WWB course. Below are the latest release notes for reference.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Winter 2025:</strong> AI policy link added to syllabus.</li>
      <li><strong>Spring 2024:</strong> WWB course piloted B1 at full scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Winter 2024:</strong> WWB course developed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Student Outreach Overview</h2>
    <p>This course is designed to support and mentor students. The inclusion of certified graders frees you to spend more time on one-to-one outreach. Remember the Student Outreach principles from your OL 110 WWB Instructor Certification course.</p>

    <p>Student Outreach generally falls into categories like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-participating & Failing Students</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Missing Assignments</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Low Performing Students</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Positive Outreach</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Inspired Outreach</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Use students' personal email <em>in addition</em> to Canvas Inbox for outreach if available. You can find personal emails via the Contact List in Canvas.</p>
    <div><img src="images/ContactList.png" alt="Contact List" /></div>

    <h2>Tracking Your Outreach</h2>
    <p>Keep track of who you’ve messaged so you don’t duplicate efforts. You can use the Gradebook notes column or a spreadsheet.</p>
    <div><img src="images/TrackingExample.png" alt="Tracking Example" /></div>

    <h2>Centrally Managed Graders</h2>
    <p>This course uses certified graders. Please do not adjust grades in the Gradebook. Contact the ACL or your supervisor if you disagree with any grade. Students can resubmit assignments 1-2 times by default, or more if you allow it for the entire class.</p>
    <p>If potential academic dishonesty arises, graders will note it in their queue, and you will be notified. You then address the student accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Student Support & Escalation</h2>
    <p>Encourage students to use the Student Portal for common non-course-specific questions, or fill out the Escalations form if more help is needed.</p>
    <div><img src="images/StudentSupportFAML220.png" alt="Student Support" /></div>

    <h2>Dates, Late Work & Extra Credit</h2>
    <p>All assignments open at the start of the course. Typically, weeks 1-4 have an Until Date <em>14 days after</em> the due date; weeks 5-7 until Thursday of week 7. Late work is allowed during that window. No extra credit is offered in this course.</p>

    <h2>Every Week</h2>
    <p>Facilitate and coach students to find success. You won't be grading, so focus on monitoring the Gradebook, encouraging students, posting announcements, and messaging individuals. Most of your time will be spent on outreach.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily:</strong> Check email, respond to discussion/announcement questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Before the week begins:</strong> Review that week's notes, post an announcement, possibly work through the assignments yourself if you're new.</li>
      <li><strong>During the week:</strong> Complete outreach, participate in class discussions, ensure grading is up to date (contact your ACL if not).</li>
    </ul>
